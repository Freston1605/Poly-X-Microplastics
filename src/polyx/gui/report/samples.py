    ``formas`` is a list of ``(Detection, ruta)`` pairs. At most

    Before, the FIRST ones by file name order entered, which had two bad
    consequences:

      * The LARGEST particle — the one backing any claim about maximum
        size — could be left out for living in a high-numbered photo.
      * Fibers never showed up in practice. They are ~1% of the material,
        so the cut arrived long before finding one. And the fiber is
        exactly the case where the geodesic diameter acts: if no
        measurement is seen, there is no way to judge whether that method
        works.

    Now the sample is split between the two morphotypes, in halves, and
    within each one size rules. That way the largest of each type always
    enters.

    The split is not rigid: if there are not enough fibers — the normal
    case — the biggest particles fill the gap instead of returning a
    short sample. And the other way around too.

    It is a deliberately BIASED sample, not representative of the batch;
    the report declares that where it shows it.
